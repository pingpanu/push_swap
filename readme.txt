-- Introduction --
  Push_swap is a program that replicate children toy called Rainbow tower.
The program will rearrange part (pieces) in pillar A in ascending order from top to base.
It have a constraint that no swapped pieces in pillar A or B in descending order.

To put it simple, consider this 5 stacked tower

A             B
3
2
1
5
4

You can't swap like this

A             B
              
              5
              1
              2
4             aa

  This program is an introduction to algorithm in 42 Bangkok, and it must capable for handing more than 100 pieces and did it with as few steps as possible.
